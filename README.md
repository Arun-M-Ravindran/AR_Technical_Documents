### $\color{orange}{1.	What Is JavaScript?}$
   JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that makes it possible to create interactive web pages and online apps with dynamic functionality. Commonly referred to as the universal language, Javascript is primarily used by developers for front-end and back-end work.

### $\color{orange}{2.	What is Interpreted programming language?}$
   An interpreter programming language is a type of programming language where the source code is executed line by line by an interpreter program, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.
   convert a code written in a high-level language into a lower-level or machine code understood by computers.

### $\color{orange}{3.	How Compilers Work}$
   A compiler translates code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language like assembly language, object code and machine code (binary 1 and 0 bits). It converts the code ahead of time before the program runs.

### $\color{orange}{4.	How Interpreters Work}$
   An interpreter translates the code line-by-line when the program is running. Youâ€™ve likely used interpreters unknowingly at some point in your work career.
